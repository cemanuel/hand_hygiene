Begin with creating_training_evaluation_and_testing.ipynb to organize raw images in correct format. Then use the path to the generated text files to assign to the values of params_initialization_for_evaluation['dev_path_zero_labeled'] and params_initialization_for_evaluation['dev_path_one_labeled'] , which should be in the sixth cell of the jupyter notebook that has the following name: 'training_hygiene_detector_sensor_**'. Choose any of these type of notebooks to evaluate an image for a given sensor.
